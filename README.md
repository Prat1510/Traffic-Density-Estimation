# Traffic-Density-Estimation

Takes in a video and estimates the queue density (total vehicle density) as well as dynamic density (moving vehicle density).
Implemented various methods for optimising or speeding up the algorithm by using subsampling, spatial multi-threading and temporal muti-threading and analysed their effect on accuracy.
